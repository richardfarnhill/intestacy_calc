#### Description:
The estate calculation was incorrect, as evidenced by the results displayed in the application. The distribution results showed "No distribution data available" despite a valid estate value being entered.

#### Steps to Reproduce:

3. Enter "457080" in the estate value input field.
4. Click the "Continue" button.
5. Select the marital status and proceed through the questions.
6. Observe the results displayed.

#### Expected Result:
The application should display a detailed distribution of the estate value, including beneficiaries and their respective shares.

#### Actual Result:
The application displayed the following message:
"No distribution data available"

#### Resolution:
- Added beneficiaries array to distribution data structure
- Ensured beneficiaries array matches shares array length
- Updated calculation logic to properly populate beneficiaries information
- Added validation to prevent "No distribution data available" message when valid data exists

#### Verification:
Test case verified with:
- Name: "bob"
- Estate Value: Â£457,080
- Marital Status: Married
- Children: Yes
- Result: Correct distribution showing spouse and children shares
