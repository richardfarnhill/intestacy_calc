## Development Priority Matrix

To guide our development efforts, we've classified each planned enhancement based on **Impact** and **Effort**:

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| üî• P1    | High   | Low    | Maximum value with minimal effort - Do First |
| üöÄ P2    | High   | High   | High value but significant effort - Plan Carefully |
| ‚ö° P3    | Low    | Low    | Easy wins but lower impact - Do When Convenient |
| ‚è±Ô∏è P4    | Low    | High   | Minimal value with high effort - Consider Later |

## Planned Enhancements

### Frontend Improvements

- **Multi-Language Support üöÄ (P2):** Add support for multiple languages to broaden accessibility
- **Enhanced UI/UX ‚ö° (P3):** 
  - Add animations for transitions between questions
  - Implement progress indicator
  - Add breadcrumb navigation
- **Accessibility Improvements üî• (P1):**

  - **Completed**: WCAG 2.1 compliance
  - Add screen reader optimizations
  - Improve keyboard navigation
- **Performance Optimization ‚è±Ô∏è (P4):**
  - Optimize code structure
  - Add service worker for offline support

### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

- **Enhanced Responses üî• (P1):** 
  - More detailed distribution explanations
  - Downloadable PDF reports
- **A/B Testing üöÄ (P3):** 
  - Test different question flows
  - Test various warning message styles
  - Test different call-to-action placements
- **Analytics Integration ‚ö° (P2):**

## Recommended Next Steps

Based on the priority matrix, we recommend focusing on **Enhanced Responses (P1)** and **Testing Improvements (P1)** as our next development areas. These features have high impact with relatively low implementation effort and would provide immediate value to users and developers by:

1. Providing more detailed explanations of inheritance distributions
2. Enabling PDF report downloads for users to save or share results
3. Preventing critical bugs through improved testing and type safety
4. Ensuring component compatibility through automated checks

These enhancements directly improve user understanding, increase the likelihood of conversion, and strengthen code quality, making them ideal next steps.
