## Development Priority Matrix

To guide our development efforts, we've classified each planned enhancement based on **Impact** and **Effort**:

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| üî• P1    | High   | Low    | Maximum value with minimal effort - Do First |
| üöÄ P2    | High   | High   | High value but significant effort - Plan Carefully |
| ‚ö° P3    | Low    | Low    | Easy wins but lower impact - Do When Convenient |
| ‚è±Ô∏è P4    | Low    | High   | Minimal value with high effort - Consider Later |

## Recommended Next Steps

Based on the priority matrix, we recommend focusing on **Enhanced Responses (P1)** as our next development area. This feature has high impact with relatively low implementation effort and would provide immediate value to users by:

1. Providing more detailed explanations of inheritance distributions
2. Adding visual charts to help users understand their situation at a glance
3. Enabling PDF report downloads for users to save or share results

This enhancement directly improves user understanding and increases the likelihood of conversion, making it an ideal next step.
